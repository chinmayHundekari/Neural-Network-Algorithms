backPropagation
===============

An implementation of backpropogation algorithm to solve multi layer neural 
networks.The goal is to create a module which takes in training data and trains 
a network with user specified number of hidden layers. Additionaly feautres like
bias and variance curves which aid in the training will also be implemented.

This project is incomplete. Execution might not succeed.
